This is the software needed to control a RGB led with an arduino through a serial port.

the circuit is a standard RGB PWM control with arduino, as you can see in http://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-strips/usage

It opens the serial port and waits for a RGB color in hex notation like #ff00ff.
it then sets the RGB led to that color and waits for your next command.

there's a node_js server that serves a jquery colorpicker and sends the selected color to the light.

run it like this

# node json_control.js

then point your browser to http://localhost:8124/ to see it!!

IDEAS:
add a nrf24l01 radio and control it through the airwaves!
